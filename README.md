### The Mitochondrial Bioenergetics of Functional Wound Closure is Dependent on Macrophage-Keratinocyte Exosomal Crosstalk
#### SUMMARY
Tissue nanotransfection (TNT) based fluorescent labeling of cell-specific exosomes have shown that exosomes play a central role in physiological keratinocyte-macrophage (mQ) crosstalk at the wound site. Here we report that during the early phase of wound re-epithelialization, macrophage-derived exosomes (ExomQ), enriched with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein TOMM70, are localized in leading-edge keratinocytes. Exosomal packaging of TOMM70 in mQ was independent of mitochondrial fission. TOMM70-enriched ExomQ compensated for the hypoxia-induced depletion of epidermal TOMM70 thereby rescuing mitochondrial metabolism in leading-edge keratinocytes. Thus, macrophage derived TOMM70 is responsible for glycolytic ATP supply to power keratinocyte migration. Blockade of exosomal uptake from keratinocytes blunted exosomal packaging of TOMM70 in microenvironmental mÔÅÜ and impaired wound closure, pointing towards a bidirectional crosstalk between these two cell types.  The significance of such bidirectional crosstalk was established by the observation that in patients with non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, TOMM70 is deficient in keratinocytes of wound-edge tissue.
